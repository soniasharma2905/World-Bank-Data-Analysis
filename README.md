# World-Bank-Data-Analysis
# What this EDA covers
- Load and clean World Bank population dataset (Total population from 1960 to 2024)
- Filter data by specific country names and years.
- Compare population growth trends across countries.
- Create visualizations like bar charts and line plots to analyze:
    - year wise population distribution.
    - top populated countries over time.

 # Libraries Used
 - pandas: for data loading and manipulating the dataset.
 - matplotlib.pyplot:  for plotting graphs.
 - seaborn: for styling and additional plotting.

 # Key Insights
 - Qatar has shown a massive increase in population from 1960 to 2024.
 - Countries like Tuvalu, Nauru and Sint Maarten have relatively low population numbers staying under 100000 across the timeline
 - Year-wise histograms and total value charts reveal how population dynamics evolved cinsistently across decades.
 - The diostribution remains right-skewed, with a few countries dominating the population charts.
